# Overview

I want to gain a better understanding for back end development so that is what this project will hopefully help me with. 

I followed a fellow programmers tutorial to make this so it isn't my own design. 

The project is a simple django site that lets an admin create and add books to a database and the user can look at them and their information.

# Web Pages

The site has a admin login page which will take you to the admin dashboard. There you are able to create books that each have their own webpage. Those webpages are made in a template that displays the book title and other information.

# Development Environment

This project was done using Visual Studio Code.

I used Python and the Django library.

# Useful Websites

* [Tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/django)
* [Django project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/contents/)

# Future Work

* Firstly, I would like to fix the issue where the main website won't load without changing the ROOT_URLCONF in the settings.
* Second, I would like to add other profiles that can be signed into instead of just the 1 admin account.
* I'd also like to add movies to the database so that it isn't just books.
